# Enchantment theme

A dark purple colorscheme for XFCE-terminal and VSCodium.


## About

Finding the perfect colorscheme for you is difficult. So I decided to make my
own. And since I primarily use XFCE I included the xfce4-terminal theme too.
Updates are only necessary if something changes ;)

I have no interest in uploading these anywhere else. Feel free to use.


## Installation


**xfce4-terminal colorscheme**

mkdir -p ~/.local/share/xfce4/terminal/colorschemes
cp xfce4/terminal/colorschemes/enchantment.theme ~/.local/share/xfce4/terminal/colorschemes


**VSCodium theme**

mkdir -p /usr/share/codium/resources/app/extensions/
cp -r codium/resources/app/extensions/theme-enchantment /usr/share/codium/resources/app/extensions/
